# hamjam

I use [gmail's filters](http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=6579) to demote emails from services, brands, etc: emails that I may want to read but definitely don't want to interrupt my day. This type of solicited spam is occasionally called "ham".

Anywho, hamjam is a crude attempt to clean up my ham filter list. It will alphabetize and let you remove the ones you no longer need, which is handy if you sign up for lots of beta apps like I do.

Let me know if it's useful for you. (It may not be.)
